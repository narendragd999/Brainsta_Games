Aliens Platformer 2D â€” Best-effort clone
Files:
- index.html
- style.css
- game.js

How to run:
Unzip and open index.html in a browser. For local server, `python -m http.server` in the folder then open http://localhost:8000

Notes:
- This is a recreated version based on the Rosebud project page. Graphics are simple shapes for portability.
- If you want exact art/music from the Rosebud version, provide the assets or allow me to extract visuals/sounds and I will try to replicate them more closely.
