Combined package: Aliens Platformer 2D (Themed)

Contents:
- index.html
- style.css
- game.js
- README.txt

What I included:
- Recreated the gameplay similar to the Rosebud "Aliens Platformer 2D" page (platformer with enemies, jump, goals).
- Applied your theme prompt fully:
  - Gradient background (#6a11cb -> #fff)
  - Blue primary buttons (#3498db)
  - Purple secondary buttons (#6a11cb)
  - White cards with rounded corners & subtle shadow
  - Loader overlay (dark translucent) with white spinner
  - Audio for movements, button presses, drag events
  - Drag-to-move + touch buttons + keyboard input
  - 10 levels, responsive layout, compact controls
- No external assets; simple flaticon-like SVG included inline for future use.

How to run:
- Unzip and open index.html in mobile/desktop browser.
- If browser blocks audio on file://, serve with local server: `python -m http.server 8000` then open http://localhost:8000

If you want:
- Exact art/music from the Rosebud page: provide assets or allow me to extract them (mind copyright).
- I can further polish sprites, add particle effects, or make levels identical to the original.
