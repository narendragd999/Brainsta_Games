Fruit Slice - Realistic-style (Generated Assets)
-----------------------------------------------
This package contains a responsive HTML5 game that uses higher-quality generated PNGs
that resemble realistic fruits, plus a bomb image. All assets are included in the root
under the assets/ folder so the game works fully offline.

Files at root:
- index.html
- style.css
- main.js
- README.txt
- assets/ (apple.png, orange.png, watermelon.png, banana.png, kiwi.png, bomb.png,
           bg.jpg, logo.png, splash.png, slice_juicy.wav, slice_pop.wav, explosion.wav)

How to run:
- Unzip and open index.html in a modern browser (mobile or desktop).
- Use touch or mouse to swipe across fruits. Avoid slicing bombs (slicing a bomb ends the game).

Note: I couldn't download external internet images from this environment, so I generated
high-resolution photorealistic-style PNGs here. If you still want *actual photographic* PNGs
from the web, I can instead supply a list of high-quality free-image sources & a zip script
you can run locally to download them, or create a zip that references remote URLs.
