Files at root:
- index.html
- style.css
- game.js
- are_pagal.mp3  (your voice file used for effects)
- sticker.png
- README.txt

Features:
- Endless, addictive gameplay: characters spawn faster over time.
- Combo & Multiplier system: build combos to increase score multiplier.
- Power-ups: occasional star powerups grant bonuses (+50 points, combo boost, slow time).
- Visual confetti and floating feedback on hits.
- Local high-score saved to localStorage; simple achievements unlocked and stored.
- Touch-first; works on phones and adapts to screen sizes.
- Uses the provided 'are_pagal.mp3' as audio for taps and events.

How to use:
1. Unzip and upload files to your phone's web server or open index.html in a mobile browser.
2. Allow sound in the browser when prompted. For Android WebView, serve via HTTP if needed.
3. Play by tapping characters; build combos and collect power-ups. Your best score saves locally.

Notes & Tips:
- If audio doesn't play, check browser autoplay policies: user must interact (tap) first to enable sound.
- You can replace are_pagal.mp3 with other sounds; keep the filename same or update index.html references.
