Super Funny Pop â€” Android-ready package

Files in root of ZIP. To use:
1. Extract the ZIP on the server or Android device so files are at the same folder level.
2. Best: serve files via HTTP (python -m http.server 8000) and open http://<ip>:8000
3. Tap "Tap to Start" to unlock audio and start background music.
4. Tap the character to trigger confetti, funny sounds, vibrations and random lines.

Root files:
- index.html
- style.css
- main.js
- boing.mp3, fart.mp3, laugh.mp3, scream.mp3, crowd.mp3, bgm.mp3
- player.png (placeholder)
- README.md

If audio problems occur in certain WebViews, host files on HTTP and try again.
